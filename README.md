index.php ### 
^ No longer used, now using directly .html


datadb.php ### 
Update: now, it doesn't use the table creation funcionality it had, but it performs the connection with the MYSQL database on RDS (Amazon AWS).

Future changes:
Better User Experience:
    - Be able to move around and not only centered on the mark
    - Button to return to the center where the mark is at the moment
    - Table INSIDE/ABOVE the leaflet (above != on top, over)
